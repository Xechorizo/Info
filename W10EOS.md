- *Note - I would give Microsoft $30 per year rather than give them data for "free" extended support*.

- *Note - Walkthroughs to migrate to long term servicing channel (LTSC) Windows with official Microsoft software are typically safe, but understand what you are doing before following them. Third party tools can be spyware, adware, malware or worse. Their use, or manipulations of activation processes outside Microsoft licensing agreements, are NOT recommended.*
